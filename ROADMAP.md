# basic types
- ~~"With" structs (enumerates entity relations)~~
- ~~include converters to basic types + StructuredValue~~
- ~~include field errors container~~

# data loading
- structs with types mapped from Coda
- Row interface
- shallow struct constructors per table
- decorator constructors to load relations (leveraging "With" structs)
